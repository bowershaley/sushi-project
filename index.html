          <h3>What is Sushi?</h3>
          <p>
            Sushi is a Japanese dish of prepared vinegared rice, usually with
            some sugar and salt, plus a variety of ingredients such as
            vegetables, and any meat, but most commonly seafood (often raw but
            can be cooked). Styles of sushi and its presentation vary widely,
            but the one key ingredient is "sushi rice", also referred to as
            shari, or sumeshi.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is very often prepared with seafood, such as squid, eel,
            yellowtail, salmon, tuna or imitation crab meat. Many types of sushi
            are vegetarian.

              <p>
                Nigiri sushi is not rolled. Instead, the thinly sliced
                fish—either raw or cooked—is set atop a mound of vinegared rice.
                In between the rice and fish, sushi chefs will often place
                either a small amount of wasabi or toasted seaweed.

                This type of sushi boasts a sheet of nori (i.e., seaweed) on the
                outside, which is wrapped around sushi rice to help contain both
                the rice and the sushi filling at the center. These rolls can
                also be simple or more complex.

                Uramaki is an inside-out roll with rice on the outside, followed
                by a sheet of nori and sushi filling at the center. The
                traditional maki version of sushi is very popular in Japan,
                while uramaki is often preferred in America.
