          <h3>What is Sushi?</h3>
          <p>
            Sushi is a Japanese dish of prepared vinegared rice, usually with
            some sugar and salt, plus a variety of ingredients such as
            vegetables, and any meat, but most commonly seafood (often raw but
            can be cooked). Styles of sushi and its presentation vary widely,
            but the one key ingredient is "sushi rice", also referred to as
            shari, or sumeshi.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is very often prepared with seafood, such as squid, eel,
            yellowtail, salmon, tuna or imitation crab meat. Many types of sushi
            are vegetarian.
